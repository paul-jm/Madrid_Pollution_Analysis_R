# Madrid_Pollution_Analysis_R
The analysis was carried out in R. 

The aim of the Madrid Pollution Analysis project was to compile and analyze hourly pollution data from more than 20 stations across the city and several different pollutants. 
Our team created interactive data visualizations, and introduced considered explanatory variables to determine the city's pollution levels.
